# Development case
## Guess the number
Letâ€™s create a small game in HTML5.
The purpose of the game is to guess a number.
### Here are the specifications :
The game computes a random number between 1 and 999, the user has to guess it.
For each try, the computer will give the indication whether the guess if too high or too low.
The game ends when the user enters the right value.
The game shows a congratulation message with the number of guesses and the time taken to guess the correct number.
The UI should show a text field to enter the number and a button to submit the number (the form).
The UI should also show a list of the last 5 guesses and the result of the guess (too high or too low).
On a desktop or a tablet, the form and the list should be displayed side by side.
On a mobile, the list should be displayed above the form. The button should be bigger to be more touch friendly
**Constraint: Use AngularJS 1.x and use at least one custom directive**
You will deliver that program as you would on a classic development project. It should be immediately runnable and testable.
